# UbqOS Bee Parser

UbqOS Bee Parser is a component of Bee but used in
 other projects of UbqOS like Marshal.

Bee files are like Yaml files but allow arguments
and with defined sections to allow us to write Bee tasks
in an human friendly way.

Bee is a task manager like make, ant or phing.
Bee files is a port of Yaml to define all tasks
as ant or phing does with XML.

Bee Parser is a fork of Symfony Yaml
but without backward compatibility.


## Roadmap

-
- Add arguments.
